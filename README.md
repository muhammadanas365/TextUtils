# TextUtils
A simple text utility website made in Django. This is my first ever project in Django! 

Here's what it can do:

1. Remove Punctuations
2. Upper Case
3. Lower Case
4. New Line Remover
5. Extra Spaces Remover
6. Remove Numbers
7. Count the Characters (Excluding Spaces)
8. Count Spaces or Not?

As said, very basic but does demonstrate some backend skills. All of this could be done easily in JavaScript but what's the fun in that! I did this in Python via 
Django framework! Totally sick!
